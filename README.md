**Aurus** is a WIP **free** **open-source** Minecraft mod, our plan is to make a mineraft mod where you will explore the **ocean** and find ruins of an **ancient civilization**, fight bosses, collect **ancient artifacts** and **weapons**. 
But remember, we are still in **early stages of developments** so it can change a bit.

⚠️ **Since we are still in development, the updates won't be frequent. We will only update when we completely add a feature, but that doesn't mean that if we launch something in an update, we won't update it anymore!**

**Will this mod work with X mod?**

* We still don't know which mods will be required. The only mods that we know will be required are **Fabric API** and **GeckoLib**.
